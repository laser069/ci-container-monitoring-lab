# ci-container-monitoring-lab

A small, fully local DevOps stack that wires a single commit all the way to a
running, monitored service:

**commit → CI → container → deploy → dashboard**

The stack contains:

- **app/** — a Node.js + Express service exposing `/`, `/health`, `/metrics` and `/work`
- **Dockerfile** — builds the service image
- **docker-compose.yml** — runs the app, Prometheus and Grafana together
- **prometheus/** — Prometheus scrape configuration
- **grafana/** — provisioned datasource and a "Service Overview" dashboard
- **.github/workflows/ci.yml** — GitHub Actions pipeline (install, test, build, smoke test)

Everything runs locally and for free. No cloud account or billing is required.

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (only needed if you want to run tests outside a container)
- `git`, `curl`

## Run the stack

```bash
docker compose up -d          # build + start app, Prometheus, Grafana
docker compose ps             # show container status and health
docker compose logs -f app    # follow the application logs
```

Services once up:

| Service     | URL                      |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| App         | http://localhost:8080    |
| Prometheus  | http://localhost:9090    |
| Grafana     | http://localhost:3000    |

Grafana logs in anonymously (admin/admin also works). Open the **Service
Overview** dashboard under the **Lab** folder.

Tear down:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Verify the service

```bash
curl localhost:8080/health     # -> {"status":"ok"}
curl localhost:8080/           # -> service metadata
curl localhost:8080/metrics    # -> Prometheus metrics
```

Check the Prometheus scrape target:

```
http://localhost:9090/targets   # the app target should be UP
```

## Generate sample traffic

```bash
./scripts/generate-traffic.sh                       # defaults to localhost:8080
./scripts/generate-traffic.sh http://localhost:8080 500
```

Then watch the panels in the Grafana **Service Overview** dashboard update.

## Run the tests locally

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm test
```

## GitHub Actions

The workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs automatically on every push and
pull request. It installs dependencies, runs the unit tests, builds the Docker
image and smoke-tests the running container. Watch it under the **Actions** tab
of your fork, or trigger it by pushing a commit / opening a PR.

## Rollback

Releases are tagged in Git. You can inspect history with:

```bash
git log --oneline
git tag
```

To roll a bad release back to a previous version, either revert the offending
commit and redeploy, or rebuild from a previous tag:

```bash
git revert <commit>          # revert a bad release
docker compose up -d --build # redeploy the reverted version
```

## Cloud mapping (documentation only)

This same flow maps onto Google Cloud without changing much. No deployment
happens here, this is just notes on the equivalent cloud release path.

Build and push: instead of `docker build` on a local machine, CI (or Cloud
Build) builds the same `Dockerfile` and pushes the image to Artifact
Registry, tagged per commit SHA the way the image is tagged `:ci` here.

Deploy: instead of `docker compose up`, the image gets deployed to Cloud Run
as a service. Cloud Run manages the container lifecycle that `docker-compose.yml`
handles locally: it reads `PORT` from the environment the same way the app
already does, and runs the same `/health` check as a liveness probe.

Observe: instead of Prometheus scraping `/metrics` and Grafana dashboarding
it, Cloud Monitoring scrapes the same endpoint (Cloud Run supports Prometheus
scrape format) and the existing panel queries become Cloud Monitoring charts
or an exported dashboard. Logs replace `docker compose logs` with Cloud
Logging.

Rollback: Cloud Run keeps every deployed revision, so a bad release rolls
back by shifting traffic to the previous revision instead of `git revert` +
redeploy — the same idea, just a managed version of it.
